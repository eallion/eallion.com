Here's my random photo page. Since I'm not much of a photographer, I've named it "Handy Shots", which really doesn't qualify as an album. It's referenced by the API of my own deployed [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) instance, [e5n.cc](https://e5n.cc), so that when posted a toot, the media file is automatically parsed to this page, with no particular intent.
