From the very beginning of building my website 20 years ago, my link page has not existed for SEO or any other messy purpose. The earliest link page was similar to a navigation site, and then I specifically deployed a personal navigation site [s.eallion.com](https://s.eallion.com), and slowly the link page became a collection of content that I liked, and then even the content that I liked was not much. But because friends have the need to exchange links, this page has always existed.
There is no requirement in principle to apply for a friendship link, please send an email or submit [PR](https://github.com/eallion/eallion.com/blob/main/data/friends/links.json) .
