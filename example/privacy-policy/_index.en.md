You can refuse or manage cookies or web beacons through browser settings. However, please note that if you disable cookies or web beacons, you may not be able to enjoy the best service experience, and certain services may not function properly. At the same time, you will still receive the same number of advertisements, but the relevance of these advertisements to you may decrease.
